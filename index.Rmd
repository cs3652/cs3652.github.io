### I have a webpage!

And I can put all kinds of stuff on it!

Navbar in the _sit.yml is the top navigation bar
internal links don't need the full webaddress
but external webpages do need it 

##add some links
syntax is square bracket for text that you want to be a link and then the link in regular parentheses
i like [google tings](https://www.google.com)

link to internal site like [about](about.html)

images. you can create a folder for images or use the same directory. just use the appropriate directory name 

<img src="images/image.jpg" style="width:75%">

use the correct directory and image address
